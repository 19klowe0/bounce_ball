# bounce_ball
A simple test of collision handling on a unlevel disk and collision with balls themselves. 

done in CSC 316 during class

more detail-

The balls are put onto the disk at random and then bounce back with a specified velocity. 
since the plane is unlevel the bouce back won't be just straight up and collision will happen between the balls themselves.
